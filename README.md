#Number List Generator

This program was developed to generate large lists of numbers which can be identical, sorted, reverse-sorted, or random. 
The numbers are saved to a designated text file. It is useful for generating large lists of numbers for use 
in testing algorithms. It can be used for small lists as well. It does have a max size for the list; 
however, that max size is sufficiently large so as to not be a major concern.
